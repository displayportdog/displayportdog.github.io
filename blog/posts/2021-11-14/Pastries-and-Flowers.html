                <p>
                    Scientists have theorised that our universe - or, at least, what we know of it - came into existence around fourteen billion years ago. That our friends, our family, our pets, and everything we have come to know and love, all came from one tiny little point in space. Everything suddenly grew, the entire universe rapidly getting bigger and bigger - and that tiny little dot became our planets, our stars, our moons, and our galaxies.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And so it left Alya wondering, how, exactly, after all this expansion, Marinette was still so dense.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Alya <i>knew</i> that Adrien reciprocated her best friend's feelings; The blond model had made it painfully obvious, but the aspiring fashion designer was clearly not astute enough to pick up on the less-than-subtle hints.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "He gave you a red rose, girl." Alya said, flatly, very much wishing for a change of topic, "What else could it mean?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Maybe he thinks I <i>like</i> red roses, Alya!" Whined Marinette, "He's been locked up by his dad for half a decade, he might not know what they mean!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    The journalist let out a huff of disbelief at her friend's comment. She knew that the boy wasn't the most socially apt, but red roses? <i>Everyone</i> knew what those meant. Except Marinette, apparently.
                </p>

                <p><br />
                </p><hr />

                <p><br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I was too forward, wasn't I?" Questioned Adrien, his forest green eyes boring holes into the ceiling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Or not forward enough is more like it." Mumbled a tiny black creature, hovering inches above the teen's face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Adrien had been deliberating over his decision for weeks. Since the shocking revelation that his mousy classmate and bold partner were somehow one in the same, he'd been thinking of a sure-fire way to secure her heart. He'd once assured her, despite her complete lack of interest, that regardless of her identity, he'd still love her the same. It had been somewhat of a half truth at the time - Adrien wasn't sure if he could stomach her being someone such as his Italian classmate - but even so, he'd found that after they'd shared their secrets, he'd fallen deeper in love with her than he'd ever been before.
                </p>

                <p>
                    So, following the advice of his best friend, he'd gone for the big guns. Huge, unmistakably romantic gestures, that she'd completely ignored and mistaken for friendship. Either he'd overestimated Marinette's intelligence, or she wasn't interested in the slightest and didn't know how to let him down gently. He'd given her a red rose, for crying out loud - could he <i>be</i> anymore obvious?
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I think your girlfriend is a little thick."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Plagg!" Cried Adrien, "You can't say things like that!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "And <i>you</i> can't get your bug to love you back. So who's <i>really</i> losing here?" The kwami smirked.
                </p>

                <p><br />
                </p><hr />

                <p><br />
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Repeat after me, okay? I am confident, and I am ready." Instructed Alya.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I am confident, and I am ready." Marinette repeated breathlessly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I am going to tell Adrien I love him."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I am going to te- <i>you what</i>?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Just say it, girl!" Commanded Alya, desperation in her tone as she shook the blue-haired student by her shoulders.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "I can't do that!" Shrieked Marinette, "It'll be so awkward! He just sees me as a friend!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "A friend he writes love poems for? You have to be joking - I am not letting you leave this building today without confessing to your sunshine boy."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "What are you two on about?" Called a sudden voice from behind. The headphone wearing DJ wore a curious expression, his wide eyed friend trailing behind him.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Oh, Nino, Adrien!" Alya said cheerily, with a mischievous grin, "What impeccable timing! Marinette was just talking about how she was in love wi-" The sound of Marinette's palm colliding with Alya's mouth echoed through the school's hallway.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "With croissants! Oh, boy do I love pastries!" The baker's daughter helpfully completed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    'What about me?' Adrien thought glumly to himself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Marinette's mouth opened in shock. Her eyebrows rising in shock and sheer incredulity at his brazen comment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Dude..." said Nino, "smooth." Adrien's best friend had the widest, most self-satisfied smirk plastered across his face.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Did... did I say that aloud?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    A million questions were running through the model's head. Why had he said that? What was she thinking? Had he just ruined their friendship of several years?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, he wasn't going to get his answers, because Marinette had sprinted from the scene at record speed.
