        <h1 style="text-align: left;">Here are some things that Jenson can do:</h1>
        <h2>help</h2>
        <p>Display all available commands. Probably how you ended up here.</p>
        <h3>gm, ga, ge, gn</h3>
        <p>Greetings and farewells! Jenson has a bunch of prefabricated messages, one of which will be randomly selected and sent when you use this command.</p>
        <h3>sprint</h3>
        <p>Run a sprint! !sprint duration message. (e.g. !sprint 10m written more?)</p>
        <h3>join</h3>
        <p>Join an ongoing sprint! !join sprintnumber message (e.g. !join 2 written more?)</p>
        <h3>whois</h3>
        <p>Brings up a users AO3 profile! (if linked)</p>
        <h3>guildinfo</h3>
        <p>Get information about the current guild! This doesn't need or even accept any arguments.</p>
        <h3>meow/woof/screech</h3>
        <p>This one grabs a random cat (!meow), dog (!woof), or fox (!screech) picture. They're all cute, but they're not mine, unfortunately.</p>
        <h3>gif</h3>
        <p>This one just searches for gifs. '!gif sad'. Go wild.</p>
        <h3>define</h3>
        <p>Defines your word, and gives you a bunch of synonyms. Doesn't really work too well with conjugated verbs, but will  still give you a cambridge link. '!define word'</p>
        <h3>synonymise</h3>
        <p>Shows synonyms for your word. Exactly the same as define, just a little bit quicker if you don't want a definition.</p>
        <h3>urban</h3>
        <p>Defines your word, but on urban dictionary. 98% chance of something weird or gross coming out of that one - not my fault!</p>
        <h3>lvl</h3>
        <p>Shows your current level in a little level card. Cute! Tag other users to get theirs - e.g. '!lvl @dpdog'</p>
        <h3>leaderboard</h3>
        <p>Shows the server XP leaderboard. Will display top 20 by default, add a number on the end to go through pages.</p>
        <h3>coinflip</h3>
        <p>Flip a pound coin! Returns heads, tails, or if you're very unlucky, the coin's edge.</p>
        <h3>choose/roll</h3>
        <p>This one requires arguments - it picks an item out of a list of items. For example '!choose red, green, blue, yellow' could return red, but also any of the other three options. The neat part is you don't know which one it'll spit out.</p>
        <h3>poll</h3>
        <p>Create a poll! You can simply pose a yes or no question (e.g. '!poll Movie night tonight?') or add options (e.g. '!poll Movie night? | tonight | wednesday | thursday | not feeling it').</p>
        <h3>yeet</h3>
        <p>Send a user to be productive. Sends a prefabricated embed. '!yeet @dpdog'</p>
        <h3>yeetsleep</h3>
        <p>Force your friends to sleep! It's being cruel to be kind, isn't it? '!yeetsleep @dpdog'</p>
        <h3>prompt</h3>
        <p>Get inspired! Gets a random prompt from /r/writingprompts.</p>
        <h3>cookie</h3>
        <p>Gives a virtual cookie to the tagged user. This isn't tallied, it's just fun. '!cookie @dpdog'</p>
        <h3>hug</h3>
        <p>Everyone deserves love! Hug the recipient. This is tallied, and your hug counter will increase each time! '!hug @dpdog'</p>
        <h3>bday</h3>
        <p>Displays your birthday, as far as the bot knows, and tells you if it's today (though I think you should really know)</p>
        <h3>bday-set</h3>
        <p>Set your birthday. You should include the timezone that your country is in on your birthday, as a difference from UTC. e.g. 'bday-set 04/10 +1' would set your birthday to the 4th of October, in UTC+1 (UK Daylight Savings)</p>
        <h3>bday-upcoming</h3>
        <p>Show the next ten upcoming birthdays.</p>
        <h3>suggest</h3>
        <p>Suggest something! e.g. '!suggest memes channel'</p>
        <h3>link-ao3</h3>
        <p>Links your AO3 profile to your page!</p>
        <h1>     </h1>
        <h2 style="text-align: left;">On AO3 Link Detection</h2>
        <p>At the moment, Jenson loads your shared story's webpage, grabs the relevant data, and packages it up all nice and neat for you. This is a really bodged together feature, so it would be appreciated if any feedback were forwarded on to me.</p>
